# cnake - The most easily embeddable scripting language for C++ (because it's not a language)

**cnake is a C++ library** that sands off all the sharp edges of C++ syntax and scemantics, giving it the vibe of a dynamically typed, memory managed scripting language, similar Python or Lua. 

## Why use cnake?
You get the **worst** of both worlds: 
- The performance of Python.
- The compile times of C++.
